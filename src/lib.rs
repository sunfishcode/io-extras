//! This crate provides a few miscellaneous utilities related to I/O:
//!
//! - `HandleOrSocket` types and traits for Windows, which abstract over
//!   Windows `*Handle*` and their corresponding Windows `*Socket*` types and
//!   traits.
//!
//! - `Grip` types and traits, which abstract over the aforementioned Windows
//!   `HandleOrSocket` types and traits and their corresponding non-Windows
//!   `Fd` types and traits.
//!
//! - `RawReadable` and `RawWritable`, which adapt a raw `Fd`/`Handle` to
//!   implement the `Read` and `Write` traits, respectively.
//!
//! - `ReadWrite` traits, and supporting types, which provide abstractions over
//!   types with one or two I/O resources, for reading and for writing.
