This crate provides a few miscellaneous utilities related to I/O:

 - `HandleOrSocket` types and traits for Windows, which abstract over Windows
   `*Handle*` and their corresponding Windows `*Socket*` types and traits.

 - `Grip` types and traits, which abstract over the aforementioned Windows
   `HandleOrSocket` types and traits and their corresponding non-Windows `Fd`
   types and traits.

 - `RawReadable` and `RawWritable`, which adapt a raw `Fd`/`Handle` to
   implement the `Read` and `Write` traits, respectively.

 - `ReadWrite` traits, and supporting types, which provide abstractions over
   types with one or two I/O resources, for reading and for writing.
